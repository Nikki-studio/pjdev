Undugu Kingdom Anthem...

Our Father, God of humanity.
You created heaven and earth.
You raised our first parents as your children.
 You created everything known and unknown seen and unseen for us.
 You love is our essence.
We are your image and likeness as you willed.
Protect us from your wrath.
Protect us from the rule of foolish and wayward brother kings.
In your abundance let us walk with you in wisdom.

Bless us with children and prosperity so as to perpetuate our existence.
Bless our families and let our children be your heritage and pride.
Be with us for eternity to eternity, in body, soul and spirit.
